const body = `This thread is for folks to nominate and vote on themes for Round %num, with sign-ups to start once the winning theme is announced.

No ideas are off limits (except gum and usually genre-only suggestions), but themes should attempt to be applicable to music and lyrics. They should also be sufficiently ambiguous to allow for multiple interpretations. The highest voted theme will be used, but moderators reserve the right to veto themes deemed to be unsuitable or duplicates of previous themes (which is pretty common). Suggest your own, or feel free to re-post nominations that weren't picked from the last, or previous rounds. Then, Upvote or Downvote the picks already here. (This is the only Gob thread type that allows downvotes).

A list of previously used themes can be found [here](http://gameofbands.com/all_rounds).`
